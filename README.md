# AxisVisualizer
Archive of "mh's Visualizer", a Flash ActionScript application that visualizes the internals of an interesting padlock.

This was written in 2008, and published at http://visualizer.tosl.org/ and is now difficult to use, because Flash is not supported anymore in the year 2021: https://www.adobe.com/de/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html
